## Ingredients

- 3 cups (24floz/675ml) full-fat milk
- 1 cup (8floz/225ml) heavy cream
- 2 cups (12oz/340g) chopped bittersweet chocolate

- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- Whipped cream for serving
- Grated chocolate for serving (optional)
- 
# Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat.

2. Reduce the heat to low, add the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate starts to melt.

3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and the water together to form a runny paste. This will be stiff at first, but keep mixing until combined and smooth.

4. When the chocolate mixture comes to a simmer, add the cornstarch paste and cook, whisking continuously, for 1 minute, until the soup is thick and smooth.

5. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer for 2-3 minutes to cook out the raw taste of the cornstarch.

6. Turn off the heat and whisk in the salt and vanilla. Pass the soup through a sieve for a smooth silky result.

7. Divide the soup among six serving bowls and garnish with some freshly whipped cream and grated chocolate if you'd like. Enjoy warm.
