# Chocolate Soup

This is perhaps one of the richest, yet most beautiful desserts... it's simple and simply elegant at the same time. The sweet crunch of cinnamon toasted brioche croutons with rich, smooth, deep chocolate flavours!

## Ingredients

- 400 g brioche loaf (or rolls)
- 150 g salted butter, melted
- 100 g soft brown sugar
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 500 ml milk
- 500 ml double cream
- 400 g dark chocolate (strong cocoa %)
- 1 tbsp cornflour
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 2 egg yolks
- 50 ml milk
- 1 tbsp cocoa nibs (optional)
- 50 ml double cream (to drizzle)
- 12 mint leaves (garnish)

# Instructions

1. Take the brioche and cut them into cubes about 2-3cm on each side. Dunk them in a bowl of melted butter, then toss in a bowl that has the brown sugar and ground cinnamon combined.
2. Preheat an oven to 180Â°C. Arrange the tossed croutons on a clean non-stick baking tray and bake for 6-8 minutes until they are golden. (They will crisp up as they cool!)
3. Heat the milk and cream up in a large saucepan until almost boiling. Snap the chocolate int much smaller squares. Drop the chocolate into the warm milk/cream and stir until it all melts and becomes sensually smooth!
4. Stir the cocoa powder, cornflour and egg yolks together with a an extra splash of cold milk until it becomes a smooth paste. Spoon the paste into the hot soup as you whisk and it'll thicken within a minute or so.
5. Serve a ladle of soup in a warm bowl with croutons on top, a drizzle of extra cream, scattering of crunchy cocoa nibs and a few fresh mint leaves.

# Silky Smooth Chocolate Soup

Somewhere between hot chocolate and warm chocolate pudding, my Chocolate Soup recipe is a perfectly sweet bowl of the chocolate flavor you crave.

Source: https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/silky-smooth-chocolate-soup/

## Ingredients

- 3 cups (24floz/675ml) full-fat milk
- 1 cup (8floz/225ml) heavy cream
- 2 cups (12oz/340g) chopped bittersweet chocolate

- 3 tablespoons cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- Whipped cream for serving
- Grated chocolate for serving (optional)
- 
# Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat.

2. Reduce the heat to low, add the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate starts to melt.

3. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and the water together to form a runny paste. This will be stiff at first, but keep mixing until combined and smooth.

4. When the chocolate mixture comes to a simmer, add the cornstarch paste and cook, whisking continuously, for 1 minute, until the soup is thick and smooth.

5. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer for 2-3 minutes to cook out the raw taste of the cornstarch.

6. Turn off the heat and whisk in the salt and vanilla. Pass the soup through a sieve for a smooth silky result.

7. Divide the soup among six serving bowls and garnish with some freshly whipped cream and grated chocolate if you'd like. Enjoy warm.
