# Homemade Pork Breakfast Sausage

In general, homemade is better than store-bought, and this spiced pork sausage is no exception. Taking a mere 15 minutes, and calling for just ground pork and pantry spices, this sausage mixture makes breakfast patties with a kick; if you want a milder sausage, feel free to leave out the cayenne and red pepper flakes or use a little less.


For even fresher sausage, grind pork loin or lean pork shoulder with a meat grinder or mince it in the food processor. Remember to cook ground pork to a minimum of 160 F, using a​ food thermometer to check the temperature. To always have homemade breakfast sausage on hand, multiply the recipe, cook all of the sausage patties, and freeze some for later. Serve with your favorite egg dishes and a side of fruit.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground pork
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon dried rubbed sage
- 1 teaspoon light or dark brown sugar, packed
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
- Oil, for pan-frying

## Instructions

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients and mix with your hands until well blended.
3. Heat a little oil in a skillet over medium heat.
4. Shape the pork mixture into eight (2-ounce) patties and pan-fry, for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning to brown both sides, until the internal temperature is at least 160 F on a food thermometer.
5. Serve hot with your favorite breakfast dishes.

# Recipe Variations
For a traditional sage flavor, use 2 teaspoons of dried rubbed sage and omit the thyme, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes.
For a healthier version, substitute ground turkey meat for the pork, which will lower the level of saturated fat.

# Question
Is There a Difference Between Breakfast Sausage Patties and Links?

In addition to the differences in shape, there are other variations between breakfast patties and links. Some links have a casing while patties do not, and patties are often more strongly flavored compared to the links.

## Ingredients

- 800 g pork shoulder
- 200 g pork belly
- 1 glass red wine
- 1 tsp mixed spice
- 1 lemon, zested
- 1 orange, zested
- 1 knob(s) ginger, grated
- 3 fresh sage leaves
- 2 pinch(es) salt and pepper
- 1 portion(s) pigs intestine, in salty brine

## Instructions

1. Reduce the glass of wine to syrup in a saucepan, keep going until you're left with about a shot glass amount. Grind the pork belly and shoulder in a machine to give you minced meat. (You can simply buy sausage meat from you butcher if you want to skip this stage.)
2. Mix the minced meat with salt, pepper, zest of both citrus fruit, the grated ginger, chopped sage and red wine syrup.
3. Thread the intestine onto the horn of the sausage machine and pull it right over the tip. Feed the flavoured sausage meat into machine and once it reaches the end of the horn pull the intestine back over the end and tie a knot.
4. Fill the intestine evenly and equally, not forcing too much in, so you have one long sausage. Tie the end.
5. Twist the string of sausage into 6 inch sausages, making sure each twist is in the opposite direction to the last.
6. Prick the sausages all over and grill for a few minutes on each side. Makes a dozen.
