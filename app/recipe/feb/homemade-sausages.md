# Homemade Pork Breakfast Sausage

In general, homemade is better than store-bought, and this spiced pork sausage is no exception. Taking a mere 15 minutes, and calling for just ground pork and pantry spices, this sausage mixture makes breakfast patties with a kick; if you want a milder sausage, feel free to leave out the cayenne and red pepper flakes or use a little less.


For even fresher sausage, grind pork loin or lean pork shoulder with a meat grinder or mince it in the food processor. Remember to cook ground pork to a minimum of 160 F, using aâ€‹ food thermometer to check the temperature. To always have homemade breakfast sausage on hand, multiply the recipe, cook all of the sausage patties, and freeze some for later. Serve with your favorite egg dishes and a side of fruit.

# Recipe Variations
For a traditional sage flavor, use 2 teaspoons of dried rubbed sage and omit the thyme, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes.
For a healthier version, substitute ground turkey meat for the pork, which will lower the level of saturated fat.
