# Grilled Peach Salad

Grilled Peach Salad is the ultimate summer side dish recipe. The peaches are grilled until smoky and extra sweet and served with arugula, blueberries, candied curry pecans, and a honey vinaigrette. Add some goat cheese or (paleo-friendly!) diced avocado and you've just made the best grilled salad ever.
